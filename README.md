# Salient-Based Masking for Robust Domain Generalization
We design a novel masked autoencoder that uses saliency heat maps to mask and reconstruct contextually rich regions in an image. We test on the iWildCams benchmark to see if salient-based masking can improve the generalization capability of vision transformers.
